Step 1: Install the dependencies for SPADE.

        Download vs_build_tools.
  
        Under development environments -> 
              i. install the c++ build tools
              
        Under individual components -> 
             i. install MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 build tools 
             ii. Windows 10 SDK.

Step 2: Set up XMPP accounts

        Download an XMPP server or a client and register 8 XMPP email accounts. (Each agent needs an XMPP email. There are 8 agents in this system.)
        If using online XMPP servers rather than running a local one, choosing the 8 accounts from at least 4 different servers is better.

Step 4: Install the relevant Python libraries

        pip install spade
        pip install pygame

Step 5: Run the simulation

        run the "smartRoomSimu.py" file.
